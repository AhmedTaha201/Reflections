GIT is built for code and programming projects like a game

#How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
we can log the project to the commits made and use (git diff)
to see what was changed in a commit \


#How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can make mistakes freely because I can checkout a previous commit anytime.\


#Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to save my project so not to lose again on a hard-drive breakdown
