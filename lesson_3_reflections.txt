#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?		
we use remotes when working with other contributors on the same project as we need to share files\		

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I am working on a new feature I wouldn`t want to be disturbed by another one`s changes
