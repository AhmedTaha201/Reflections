#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?	

we use remotes when working with other contributors on the same project as we need to share files\		

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I am working on a new feature I wouldn`t want to be disturbed by another one`s changes\

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones are just images of the project copied to the local machine to edit
Branches are different paths on the same project allowing testing new features or making another version 
Forks are main-project-unrelated clones and we need them in case we need to work on our own version of the project or when we aren`t allowed to modifiy the origina; project\
